1) Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Code: 
select city,length(city)
from 
station
order by length(city),city
limit 1;
select city,length(city)
from station
order by length(city) desc
limit 1;

2) Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

select distinct city from station where REGEXP_LIKE(city,'^[AEIOU]');


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

select distinct city from station where city REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';



Nope, it's because the regex is wrong.

^  			// string's beginning
[aeiou]   		// a SINGLE vowel
$  			// end of string
Therefore this would match the vowels and only the vowels. Even a string like "aaa" would not match, because it's more than 1 char long.

The correct one is the one you used at the beginning because of the ".*" bit:

^			// start of string
[aeiou]			// a single vowel
.			// any characted...
*			// ...repeated any number of times
[aeiou]			// another vowel
$			// end of string
